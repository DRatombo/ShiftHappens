Many students struggle silently with managing their limited finances, often feeling stressed or overwhelmed by daily expenses, bursaries, or part-time job income. Budget Buddy was created to empower students to take control of their financial lives, turning budgeting from a tedious task into an engaging, rewarding experience. By using gamification, personalized feedback, and progress tracking, the app motivates students to build healthy financial habits, achieve their savings goals, and gain confidence in their financial decisionsâ€”helping them feel in control and less anxious about money.
